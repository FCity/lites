# Lites

## What is it?

Something like Lite-Brite. A grid of cells you can set colored lights on. Plus you can add a strobe effect to them and adjust its speed.

## How it works

Starts with a grid dimension setting prompt. You can set the number of rows and columns that you want and then it's playtime on the grid main page itself. Set all the lights you want and if you want to change the dimensions or play with the strobe effect feature, there's a control panel for you.

## Why I made it

I was setting some patio lights when it hit me: Why not make something like this with React? Just a simple light-color-and-effect-based app, like Lite-Brite, which I enjoyed as a kid.

## Technologies Used
